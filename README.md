## Introduction
In August 2013, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYCTLC) introduced Green Cabs in the New York City area aimed at residents outside Manhattan with the consideration that Yellow Cabs tend to be low in the area. Green Cabs themselves are designed to be ordered by passengers via telephone or online.
In May 2011, Uber expanded to the New York City area. Research shows that Uber has replaced rides in Yellow Cabs in downtown NYC and supplemented rides with Green Cabs outside of NYC. As such, Green Cabs have faced fierce competition from Uber since its introduction, with Uber offering lower fares and easier accessibility through its mobile app.

## Goals
Analyzing the performance of Green Cabs and Uber Taxi through visual analysis of passenger trips using Green Cabs and Uber Taxi from January to June in 2015 in the New York City area
Broadly speaking, there are two questions related to the research conducted:
* How do Green Cabs and Uber rides compare regionally in neighborhoods outside of New York City?
* Do customer preferences change according to the time of day (night/day or weekend/weekday)?
